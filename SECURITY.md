# Security Policy

If you believe you’ve found a vulnerability or a risky default in this repository,
please report it privately:

- Email: eplabsai@eplabsai.com
- Preferred subject: `[security] pulse-guard-pack`

We aim to acknowledge reports within 3 business days.

## Supported versions

- The latest `v1` major tag is supported. Older tags may receive best-effort fixes only.

## Scope

This pack provides a CI secret-leak guard. It does not replace platform-level
Secret Scanning or organization policies. For public repos, enable GitHub
Secret Scanning in parallel.
