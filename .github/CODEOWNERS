chore: add CODEOWNERS for workflows & security configs

Establish CODEOWNERS for critical paths to ensure review before merge.

Why
- auto-request review on workflow and security-sensitive changes
- enables Branch protection: "Require review from Code Owners" (optional)
- reduces risk of bypassing the secret-leak guard

Coverage
- .github/workflows/*
- .gitleaks.toml
- .pre-commit-config.yaml
- SECURITY.md

No runtime changes; governance/quality only.
